# Abstract Play: API Server

Version: unnumbered alpha

Nothing to see here yet. This project is in the very early stages. No real documentation yet, but it's coming.

The way to use this is to clone or download the repository, create a virtual environment, install the dependencies (`requirements.txt`), then run.

## Contact

The [main website](https://www.abstractplay.com) houses the development blog, wiki, and first-party front end.

## Change log

13 Jun 2017:

  * I haven't been keeping this up to date. See the [development blog](https://www.abstractplay.com/blog) for details.
  * Service runs and actually works!
  * The following resources are currently available:
    * `/`
    * `/auth` (account creation and authentication using password, Facebook, and Google are working)
    * `/users` (just the basics right now)
    * `/forms` (just authentication forms right now)
    * `/debug` (used to debug json schemas and access tokens)
    * `/games` (just the very basics at the moment; currently working on this)
  * Have the first cron job script working. There are a lot of moving parts.

03 Jun 2016:

  * Initial import.
  * Service *does* start, and my goal is to make sure that every commit will at least run.
